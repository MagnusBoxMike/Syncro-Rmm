# Syncro-Rmm

# These scripts have been created to work with Magnus Box and Syncro RMM. We are posting the different scripts here to allow us to maintain version control and ease of accesability.

# Before implementing these scripts, please open a ticket by emailing support@magnusbox.com. You can put "Syncro" in the subject line. The reason for this is to allow us to setup the API user account on your Magnus Box server.

# As always, never run a script without understanding how it works. You take full responsibility for running these scripts on your clients endpoints.
